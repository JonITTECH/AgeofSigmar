## Project Description

üõ°Ô∏è Age of Sigmar üõ°Ô∏è is a well-known tabletop role-playing game with miniatures that recreates epic battles. I am a fan of these miniatures from an artistic standpoint, with painting them being one of my main hobbies.

For a while now, I have been curious about the game itself and would like to make an amateur approach to understand how these battles work at a basic level. To achieve this, I have gathered a sample of 50 units from social media accounts that I follow and have looked up their points and characteristics to analyze them in depth.

Are you ready to fight? ‚öîÔ∏è

## Hypotheses / Questions

The goal is to classify these units, understand which ones are the best, and identify the characteristics that define them. Additionally, we aim to explore how all these data points are interconnected.

Once we have identified the key features that predict success in combat and have classified them accordingly, we will statistically analyze this data, checking for significant differences.

Finally, we will create a visualization dashboard and a website with a battle simulation, allowing us to anticipate how two armies would fare against each other based on dice rolls and their respective characteristics.
